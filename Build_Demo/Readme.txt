Flicker 2.3

Controls:

WASD - move
Mouse - menu selection, look (3D)
Shift - change dimension
Q,E - change perspective in 2D
Esc - pause

Alpha 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - teleport to new areas (debug)

Known Issues:
- In 2D, objects in foreground are visible, sometimes creating the illusion that you can walk onto something you cannot

- player floats midair when staitonary

Optimization:
This build should be played on a gaming desktop with a modern graphics card to avoid framerate lag.


Notes:
Some areas are incomplete. The area currently reached by pressing Alpha4 is a good demonstration of the compressable mechanic.
