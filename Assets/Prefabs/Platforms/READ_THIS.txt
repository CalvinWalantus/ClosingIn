REMINDER:

Use the "compressable platform" and "moving platform" objects in this folder to construct parts of the level that can be 
compressed by switching dimensions.

If you want to change the size of a platform, do not adjust the scale of the "compressable platform" object,
change the scale of the "platform body" instead. If you click the arrow next to the "compressable platform" object
in the hierarcy window (the window on the left) you should see this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> Compressable platform
	> Platform body           <--- Click on this one, then change the scale
		Platform magnet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


And for moving platforms:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> Moving platform
	...
	> Platform
		> Platform body              <--- This one
			Platmform magnet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


If you're curious, the "platform magnet" is an invisible object that keeps the player attached to the
platform while it is moving, which will automatically adjust to the size of the platform body since it
is its child.

If you're not curious, well, I hope you're happy in your narrow-minded little world.
