Join young adult/anthropomorphic candle Caedle, as they navigate through the strange new world of Dreamscape University. Much like in Trapdoor's *Fez* or Sega's *Crush*, the player possesses the ability to compress teh three-dimensional world into a two dimensional plane, simplifying the chaotic environment and revealing new, unseen paths.
